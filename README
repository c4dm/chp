Constrained Harmonic Peak plugin
================================

This is a simple Vamp plugin that returns the peak frequency within a
given frequency range, from a harmonic product spectrum.

(The whole available frequency range is used in calculating the
harmonic spectrum, but only the peak frequency within the range
specified by the plugin's parameters is returned in the result.)

It was quickly written to provide a simple way to obtain frequencies
within a user-provided range, for use in the Tony
(http://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/tony/) pitch annotation
application.
